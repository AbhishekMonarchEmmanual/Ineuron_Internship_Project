# Introduction:
The machine learning project is designed to create an app that can take the user's input about their flight travel and predict the fare price. 
Flight travel is becoming more and more common nowadays. Therefore my app can help people to know beforehand what they could be expecting the price of their ticket at any given time. 
The target audience for this app includes every common man to office-going person who is looking to travel in India via flights. 
High-Level Overview:

My app includes three main components: 
•	Data Ingestion 
•	Data Transformation & Feature Engineering
•	Model Training
